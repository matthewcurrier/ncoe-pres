# Summary

*  Most accidents occur in the __afternoon and evening__ during the summer months.
*  __Passenger vehicles__ are most often involved with driver inattention / distraction incidents.
*  Because Brooklyn leads in accidents, Safety efforts might want to target __Brooklyn first__.
*  It would be interesting to explore driver inattention / distraction more closely.
   +  ie, What _exactly_ is involved in driver inattention / distraction?
*  Additional exercises might include __mapping accidents__. (The data set includes geo cooridnates.)
*  We could enrich this data set by __adding census data__.
   + This would give us an idea if certain zip codes have a higher rate of accidents controlling for population.
